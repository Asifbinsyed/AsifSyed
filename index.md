## 👨‍💻About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="asif_headshot.webp" >

👋 Hi there! I'm **Md Asif Bin Syed**, a *Sr. Supply Chain Data Analyst* at **The Home Depot**, the world's leading home improvement retailer. At Home Depot, I leverage machine learning and reinforcement learning to optimize our delivery network - using predictive models to forecast delivery times, route optimization algorithms to determine the most efficient delivery paths, and reinforcement learning to dynamically adjust delivery schedules based on real-time conditions.

As an active researcher, I explore marine surveillance with AI, disease prediction, and drug discovery. My core expertise includes machine learning, graph neural networks, and natural language processing. Currently, I'm innovating with missing value pattern detection and chemical energy prediction. I'm passionate about advancing AI applications across both industry and scientific domains. As a member of the **Advanced Systems Analytics Lab**, I'm tackling complex track association challenges.

# Achievement In Industry 

✔ Developed a BQA workbook to calculate recommended pallet counts, validated results through an API endpoint, and constructed a pallet compliance dashboard for stakeholders, potentially generating annual savings of $2 million.
✔ Architected a "Control Tower" in python to capture vehicle rule changes to improve the accuracy of Truck Type Model.
✔ Led the data cleansing of 25M orders and developing inventory-aware sourcing logic to improve OTC performance. 
✔ Spearheaded the implementation of 120+ vehicle rule changes, maintaining Truck Type model effectiveness.
✔ Collaborated with Online Delivery Analytics team to devise an optimization model to pinpoint the optimal carrier for each vendor, maximizing discounts from the primary carriers and potentially yielding over $30 million in savings.
✔ Optimized the truck type compliance dashboard, reducing load time from 226 to 2.56 seconds (100-fold improvement). 
✔ Consistently delivered on multiple ad-hoc requests, including effectiveness analysis of new sprinter vans, rural area box additions, and extraction of pallet data for MDS.


## 🔬Research Interest

My research interests span a wide range of areas in data science and artificial intelligence. I'm passionate about machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing (NLP), and large language model (LLM) applications in supply chain management. Additionally, I have a deep interest in causal inference and graph neural network (GNN) applications in digital health and chemical composition analysis. My recent work focuses on deep learning applications in marine surveillance. I'm also keen on exploring missing value imputation techniques and assessing their credibility in various data analysis contexts.

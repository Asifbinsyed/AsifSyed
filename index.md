👋 Hi there! I'm **Md Asif Bin Syed**, a *Sr. Supply Chain Data Analyst* at **The Home Depot**, the world's leading home improvement retailer. 

As an active researcher, I explore marine surveillance with AI, disease prediction, and drug discovery. My core expertise includes machine learning, graph neural networks, and natural language processing. Currently, I'm innovating with missing value pattern detection and chemical energy prediction. I'm passionate about advancing AI applications across both industry and scientific domains. As a member of the **Advanced Systems Analytics Lab**, I'm tackling complex track association challenges.

## 🔬Research Interest

My research interests span a wide range of areas in data science and artificial intelligence. I'm passionate about machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing (NLP), and large language model (LLM) applications in supply chain management. Additionally, I have a deep interest in causal inference and graph neural network (GNN) applications in digital health and chemical composition analysis. My recent work focuses on deep learning applications in marine surveillance. I'm also keen on exploring missing value imputation techniques and assessing their credibility in various data analysis contexts.
